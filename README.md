# About

We developed a couple of projects that are interacting with etcd.

There is some repetitive boilerplate between projects to abstract away lower level details of the etcd client.

This module is meant to centralise all that boilerplate in one location and keep the dependent projects simpler.

This is our first draft and is currently very much a WIP.

# Project Status

WIP. Not ready for consumption.
